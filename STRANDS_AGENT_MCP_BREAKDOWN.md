## üì¶ Key Components Breakdown

### 1. **Environment & Configuration (Lines 1-24)**
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
import logging

# Strands-specific logging setup
logging.getLogger("strands").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

**Why This Matters for MCP:**
- Strands provides first-class integration with OpenAI models
- Built-in observability through the Strands logging framework
- Clean separation between infrastructure and business logic

---

### 2. **Secure Credential Management (Lines 26-54)**

```python
def get_database_credentials():
    """Environment-based credential management"""
    logger.debug("Retrieving database credentials")
    # Validates all required env vars exist
    # Returns structured credential dict
```

**MCP Best Practice:**
- Never hardcode credentials
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Log credential retrieval (without exposing secrets!)

---

### 3. **Database Connection Layer (Lines 56-81)**

```python
@contextmanager
def get_db_connection():
    """Context manager for safe DB connections"""
    logger.debug("Establishing database connection")
    # Auto-cleanup on exit
    # SSL required for security
```

**Key Features:**
- Context manager ensures connections always close
- RealDictCursor for easy JSON serialization
- Comprehensive error handling with logging

---

### 4. **Domain-Specific Query Functions (Lines 83-256)**

Three specialized query functions that demonstrate modularity:

#### Revenue Query (Lines 83-130)
```python
def execute_revenue_query(start_date: str = None):
    """30-day revenue trends with daily breakdowns"""
    # Smart defaults (30 days if not specified)
    # Aggregates: total, average, trends
    # Returns structured data ready for AI analysis
```

#### Product Performance (Lines 132-193)
```python
def execute_product_query(start_date: str = None, category: str = None):
    """Top performing products with sales metrics"""
    # 90-day window for product analysis
    # Category filtering capability
    # Top 15 products by revenue
```

#### Customer Analysis (Lines 195-256)
```python
def execute_customer_query(start_date: str = None, min_amount: float = None):
    """High-value customer identification"""
    # Flexible filtering by order amount
    # Customer segmentation data
    # Order pattern analysis
```

**Why This Architecture Works:**
- Each function is independent and testable
- Clear input/output contracts
- Reusable across different MCP tools

---

### 5. **Natural Language Request Router (Lines 258-307)**

```python
def analyze_business_request(user_prompt: str):
    """Smart routing based on keyword detection"""
    
    # Keyword-based intent detection
    if any(word in prompt_lower for word in ['revenue', 'sales']):
        execute_revenue_query()
    
    # Can execute multiple queries for comprehensive analysis
    # Fallback to general overview if no specific match
```

**The Magic Here:**
- Simple yet effective NLP without external dependencies
- Multi-query execution for holistic insights
- Graceful fallbacks ensure always useful output

---

### 6. **Strands Agent Integration (Lines 309-401)**

```python
def generate_business_insights(query_results, user_prompt):
    """This is where Strands Agent shines!"""
    
    # Initialize OpenAI model through Strands
    model = OpenAIModel(
        client_args={"api_key": openai_api_key},
        model_id="gpt-4o",
        params={"max_tokens": 2000, "temperature": 0.3}
    )
    
    # Create specialized business analyst agent
    analyst = Agent(
        system_prompt="""You are a senior business analyst...""",
        model=model
    )
    
    # Transform raw data into formatted context
    # Agent analyzes and generates insights
    analysis = analyst(data_summary)
```

**Why Strands Agent is Perfect for MCP Tools:**

1. **Abstraction Without Complexity**
   - Simple Agent creation with system prompts
   - Handles all OpenAI API complexity internally
   - Clean, readable code

2. **Flexibility**
   - Easy to swap models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
   - Adjustable parameters per use case
   - Could easily add tools to the agent for enhanced capabilities

3. **Production-Ready**
   - Built-in error handling
   - Automatic retries and rate limiting
   - Comprehensive logging integration

---

### 7. **Lambda Handler - The Orchestrator (Lines 403-455)**

```python
def handler(event: Dict[str, Any], _context):
    """AWS Lambda entry point - coordinates everything"""
    
    # Step 1: Analyze request & execute queries
    query_results = analyze_business_request(user_prompt)
    
    # Step 2: Generate AI insights
    insights = generate_business_insights(query_results, user_prompt)
    
    # Step 3: Return structured response
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({
            'response': insights,
            'queries_executed': query_results['queries_executed'],
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        })
    }
```

**Production Considerations:**
- Full request/response logging
- Structured error responses
- CORS headers for web integration
- Execution metadata for debugging
